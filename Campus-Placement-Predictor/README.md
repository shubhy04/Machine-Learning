# Campus Placement Predictor

This project is a basic machine learning model designed to predict the chances of students being placed during campus recruitment. The project was developed as an introductory exploration into machine learning concepts and techniques.

## Overview
The **Campus Placement Predictor** is a toy project built as part of my initial foray into machine learning. It uses student data to predict placement outcomes, providing insights that could help in understanding the factors influencing campus placement success.

## Features
- Preprocessing of student data.
- Implementation of various machine learning models to predict placement.
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to identify patterns and correlations.
3. **Model Training**: Applying different machine learning algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
5. **Results**: Analyzing the output and model performance.

## Results
The project achieved preliminary insights into factors influencing placements and showcased the model's predictive capabilities. More advanced tuning and feature engineering could enhance its predictive power.

## Future Improvements
- Adding more advanced machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Implementing hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Including feature importance analysis to identify the most influential factors.
